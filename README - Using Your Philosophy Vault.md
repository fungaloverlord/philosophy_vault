# üìñ Using Your Philosophy Learning Environment

Welcome to your structured philosophy study vault! This environment is designed following **Zettelkasten principles** and organized into **7 stages** covering 14-22 months of intensive study.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Start here**: Open [[Philosophy Dashboard]] - Your main navigation hub
2. **Begin learning**: Read [[Stage 1 - Foundations]]
3. **Understand the system**: Read [[CLAUDE.md]] for vault conventions
4. **Check the source material**: [[Study Plan v2 (claude)]] and [[Questions (claude)]] in the Unbroken folder

---

## üìÇ Vault Structure

### Note Types (Zettelkasten)

Your vault uses **5 types of notes**:

1. **Literature Notes** (`@Author - Title.md`)
   - Reading notes from primary sources
   - Example: `@Plato - Republic.md`
   - Capture key ideas, arguments, questions

2. **Permanent Notes** (Concept names)
   - Atomic ideas that stand alone
   - Example: `Eudaimonia.md`, `Theory of Forms.md`
   - One concept per note, heavily linked

3. **Question Notes** (`Q - Question.md`)
   - Philosophical questions driving inquiry
   - Example: `Q - What is the good life.md`
   - Track evolving answers across traditions

4. **Structure Notes** (`Topic - MOC.md`)
   - Maps of Content organizing domains
   - Example: `Ancient Greek Ethics - MOC.md`
   - Entry points and navigation hubs

5. **Synthesis Notes** (Descriptive titles)
   - Your original arguments and positions
   - Example: `Reconciling Aristotle and Nietzsche.md`
   - Build on permanent notes with original analysis

### Special Folders

## üìä Using the Dashboard

The [[Philosophy Dashboard]] provides:

### Progress Tracking
- **All Stages** - Status overview
- **Current Reading** - What you're reading now
- **Completed Books** - Track accomplishments

### Database Views (Obsidian Bases)

The dashboard uses Obsidian's **Bases** feature - a built-in database system that creates dynamic views of your notes.

**What are Bases?**
- Bases are `.base` files that define filtered, sorted views of your notes
- They use YAML syntax to specify filters, columns, and sorting
- Embedded in markdown using `![[filename.base]]`
- Automatically update as you change note properties

**Base Files in This Vault:**
- `Stages Progress.base` - Overview of all 7 stages
- `Books Not Started.base` - Upcoming reading list
- `Books In Progress.base` - Current readings
- `Books Completed.base` - Finished books
- `Questions Unanswered.base` - Open philosophical questions
- `Books by Branch - Ethics.base` - Ethics books
- `Books by Priority - Critical.base` - Must-read texts
- `Revisitation Due.base` - Texts to revisit

**How They Work:**
All bases filter notes based on their YAML frontmatter properties (type, status, stage, branch, priority, etc.).

### Browsing
- By Stage (1-7)
- By Branch (Ethics, Metaphysics, Epistemology, Political)
- By Period (Ancient, Medieval, Modern)
- By Priority (Critical, High, Medium)

---

## üìù Note-Taking Best Practices

### When Reading a Book

1. **Create Literature Note**:
```markdown
@Philosopher - Work Title.md
```

2. **Add YAML frontmatter**:
```yaml
---
type: literature-note
author: Name
stage: 2
branch: [ethics, metaphysics]
status: in-progress
---
```

3. **Structure**:
- Context
- Main Thesis
- Key Arguments
- Important Concepts (link to [[Permanent Notes]])
- Questions Raised
- Personal Insights

4. **Extract Concepts**:
- Create Permanent Note for each new concept
- Link bidirectionally
- Connect to existing notes

### When Creating Permanent Notes

**Atomic principle**: One idea per note

**Structure**:
- Definition (your own words)
- Origin (who introduced it?)
- Examples
- Related Concepts (10-20 links)
- Critiques
- Evolution across thinkers

### Question-Driven Learning

Use the **Five Question Types** from [[Questions (claude)]]:

1. **INTERPRETIVE** - What is the philosopher saying?
2. **CRITICAL** - Is the argument sound?
3. **COMPARATIVE** - How does this relate to others?
4. **APPLIED** - How does this matter for life?
5. **SYNTHETIC** - What is MY position?

---

## üîç Search & Discovery

### Finding Connections

1. **Graph View** - Spot clusters of related concepts
2. **Backlinks Panel** - Who references this note?
3. **Search** - How does usage evolve across texts?
4. **Tags** - Filter by philosopher, branch, period
5. **Unlinked Mentions** - Create explicit links

### Using Tags

**Hierarchical structure**:
- `#philosopher/plato`
- `#branch/ethics`
- `#period/ancient-greek`
- `#theme/virtue`

**In frontmatter** (primary categorization):
```yaml
tags: [plato, ethics, ancient-greek]
```

**Inline** (contextual):
```markdown
This connects to #master-slave-morality
```

---

## üîÑ Revisitation (Spiral Learning)

Philosophy deepens through returning to earlier texts with new knowledge.

### Revisitation Schedule

**After each stage**:
- Return to 5 key texts from earlier stages
- Add `## Revisitation - [Date]` section
- Create new connections

**Monthly**:
- Pick one earlier philosopher
- Review all their Literature Notes
- Update with recent learning

**Quarterly**:
- Write comparative essay
- Example: "Plato's Forms Through Kantian Lenses"

**Yearly**:
- Reread foundational texts:
  - Plato's Republic
  - Aristotle's Ethics
  - Nietzsche's Genealogy

### Built-in Revisitation Prompts

Each Stage note includes prompts like:
- "After Stage 4, return to Plato with these questions..."
- "After Stage 5, return to Aristotle and ask..."

---

## üéì Integration & Synthesis

### The Big Five Questions (Stage 7)

Write 2000-3000 word essays on:

1. [[Q - What Is Real]] - Metaphysics
2. [[Q - What Can We Know]] - Epistemology
3. [[Q - How Should I Live]] - Ethics
4. [[Q - What Is the Meaning of Life]] - Existential
5. [[Q - What Is the Good Society]] - Political

### Personal Philosophy Manifesto

**Capstone Project** (10,000 words):
- Part I: Metaphysics & Epistemology
- Part II: Ethics & Values
- Part III: Existential & Meaning
- Part IV: Social & Political
- Part V: Practice & Living

- Track progress and suggest next steps

---

## üîß Creating Custom Base Files

You can create your own `.base` files for custom views:

**Example: Create a "Books by Difficulty - Advanced" base**

1. Create file: `Books by Difficulty - Advanced.base`
2. Add YAML:
```yaml
formulas:
views:
  - type: table
    name: Advanced Books
    filters:
      and:
        - note["type"] == "literature-note"
        - note["difficulty"] == "advanced"
    order:
      - file.name
      - author
      - stage-name
      - status
    sort:
      - key: stage
        direction: ASC
```
3. Embed anywhere: `![[Books by Difficulty - Advanced.base]]`

**Base Syntax Reference:**

**Structure:**
- `formulas:` - Define custom formulas (can be empty)
- `views:` - Array of view definitions
  - `type:` table, list, calendar, or task
  - `name:` Display name
  - `filters:` Filter conditions
  - `order:` Properties to display as columns
  - `sort:` Sorting rules
  - `limit:` Maximum results (optional)

**Filter Syntax:**
- Access properties: `note["property-name"]`
- Equality: `note["type"] == "value"`
- Inequality: `note["status"] != "completed"`
- Contains: `contains(note["branch"], "ethics")`
- **MUST** use `and:` or `or:` at filter root
- Nest `or:` inside `and:` for complex logic

**Sort Syntax:**
- Use `key:` for property name
- Use `direction:` ASC or DESC
- Can sort by `file.name`, `file.mtime`, custom properties

## üìà Tracking Progress

### Update Book Status

In Literature Notes, change frontmatter:
```yaml
status: not-started  # ‚Üí in-progress ‚Üí completed
```

### Update Stage Status

In Stage Notes:
```yaml
status: not-started  # ‚Üí in-progress ‚Üí completed
```

### Watch the Dashboard

The [[Philosophy Dashboard]] and all `.base` files automatically update!

## üí° Tips for Success

### Do:
- ‚úÖ Read actively, create notes as you go
- ‚úÖ Link extensively (10-20 links per Permanent Note)
- ‚úÖ Write in your own words
- ‚úÖ Create Question Notes to track inquiries
- ‚úÖ Revisit earlier material regularly
- ‚úÖ Write Synthesis Notes with original thinking
- ‚úÖ Update the dashboard regularly

### Don't:
- ‚ùå Passively read without taking notes
- ‚ùå Create orphan notes (no links)
- ‚ùå Just copy quotes (understand first)
- ‚ùå Move too fast (philosophy requires slow thinking)
- ‚ùå Skip revisitation (spiral learning is key)
- ‚ùå Forget to apply concepts to life

**Remember**: Philosophy is not about accumulating answers but about deepening questions. The point is not to finish, but to continue examining, questioning, and living thoughtfully.

*"The unexamined life is not worth living." - Socrates*

*"One must still have chaos in oneself to give birth to a dancing star." - Nietzsche*

*"One must imagine Sisyphus happy." - Camus*

Now begin walking. The questions await.
