> **Source:** [Book/Article, page number]
>
> P1: [First premise]
> P2: [Second premise]
> P3: [Additional premises...]
> C: Therefore, [Conclusion]
>
> ## Validity Analysis
> Is the conclusion logically derived from the premises?
> [Your analysis]
>
> ## Soundness Analysis
> Are the premises actually true?
> [Evaluate each premise]
>
> ## My Evaluation
> Do I accept this argument? Why or why not?
> [Your position]
>
> ## Related Concepts
> - [[Concept A]]
> - [[Concept B]]
> ```
>
> **Save as:** A [[Synthesis Note]] when you complete this exercise.

> [!example]- Comparative Analysis Practice
> Choose two philosophers' definitions of philosophy (e.g., Russell vs. Warburton) and compare:
>
> ```markdown
> ## Philosopher A's View
> **Source:** [Citation]
> [Summary of their position]
>
> ## Philosopher B's View
