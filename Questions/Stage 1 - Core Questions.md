# Stage 1 — Core Questions

> [!abstract] Purpose
> Essential questions to guide your thinking through Stage 1 using the Five Question Types framework.

---

> [!tip] The Five Question Types Framework
> For every text you read in this stage, work through these five levels:
>
> 1. **INTERPRETIVE** - What is the philosopher actually saying?
> 2. **CRITICAL** - Is the argument sound and convincing?
> 3. **COMPARATIVE** - How does this relate to other thinkers?
> 4. **APPLIED** - How does this matter for life?
> 5. **SYNTHETIC** - What is MY position?
