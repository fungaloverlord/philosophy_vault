# @Aristotle - Categories

**Author**: Aristotle | **Stage**: [[Stage 2 - Ancient Greek Philosophy]] | **Branch**: Metaphysics, Logic

## Overview
Aristotle's fundamental classification of being. Introduces substance vs. accident distinctionâ€”foundational to his metaphysics and his critique of Plato.

## The Ten Categories
1. **Substance** (primary category)
2. Quantity, Quality, Relation, Place, Time, Position, State, Action, Affection

## Key Concept: Substance
**Primary substances**: Individual things (this man, this horse)
**Secondary substances**: Species and genera (man, animal)

**Contrast with Plato:** For Aristotle, Forms are in things, not separate.

**Create:** [[Substance and Accident]]

## Why It Matters
Aristotle's critique of Plato's separated Forms starts here.
