# @Plato - Euthyphro

**Author**: Plato | **Stage**: [[Stage 2 - Ancient Greek Philosophy]] | **Branch**: Ethics, Philosophy of Religion

## Overview
Socrates, on his way to trial, questions Euthyphro about the nature of piety. Classic demonstration of the Socratic method revealing the difficulty of defining moral concepts.

## Central Question
**What is piety?**

Euthyphro's failed definitions:
1. Piety = prosecuting wrongdoers (too narrow)
2. Piety = what is dear to the gods (gods disagree!)
3. Piety = what all gods love (the Euthyphro dilemma)

## The Euthyphro Dilemma
**"Is the pious loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?"**

Modern version: "Is something good because God commands it, or does God command it because it's good?"

**Create:** [[Euthyphro Dilemma]]
