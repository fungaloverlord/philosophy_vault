**Stage**: [[Stage 2 - Ancient Greek Philosophy]]
**Sub-stage**: Socrates → Plato transition
**Period**: Ancient Greek (c. 385 BCE)
**Branch**: Epistemology, Ethics

---

## 📖 Overview

- Introduces the Theory of Recollection
- The famous slave boy demonstration
- Bridges Socratic ethics and Platonic metaphysics

---

## 🎯 Key Themes

### 1. Can Virtue Be Taught?
**The paradox:**
- If virtue is knowledge, it can be taught
- But there are no teachers of virtue
- And good men's sons aren't always virtuous
- So what is virtue?

**Create:** [[Q - Can virtue be taught]]

### 2. Theory of Recollection
**The argument:**
- The soul is immortal
- It has seen all things before birth
- "Learning" is recollecting what we already know
- The slave boy demonstration proves this

**CRITICAL for Essay 2:** This is Plato's rationalist answer to "Is knowledge innate?"

**Create:** [[Theory of Recollection]]

### 3. The Slave Boy Demonstration
**What happens:**
- Uneducated slave boy "discovers" geometric theorem
- Socrates only asks questions, doesn't teach
- Plato: He's recollecting, not learning!
- Alternative: Socrates is cleverly teaching

**Questions:**
- Is Plato right?
- Or is Socrates just a good teacher?
- Does this prove innate knowledge?

### 4. True Opinion vs. Knowledge
**The distinction:**
- True opinion: right belief without justification
- Knowledge: true belief with "an account" (logos)
- Both get you to the right place
- But only knowledge is stable

**Create:** [[True Opinion vs Knowledge]]
