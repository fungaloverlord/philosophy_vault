# @Aristotle - Metaphysics

**Author**: Aristotle
**Stage**: [[Stage 2 - Ancient Greek Philosophy]]
**Period**: Ancient Greek Philosophy (4th century BCE)
**Branch**: Metaphysics
**Difficulty**: Advanced
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Reading Time**: 5-6 weeks

---

## Why Read This?

Aristotle's *Metaphysics* is the foundational text of Western metaphysics - the study of being qua being, what exists most fundamentally. This difficult but essential work:

- Establishes the vocabulary and questions of metaphysics for 2000+ years
- Provides Aristotle's critique of Plato's Theory of Forms
- Introduces crucial concepts: substance, essence, potentiality, actuality
- Presents the theory of the Unmoved Mover (influential for medieval theology)
- Shapes all subsequent ontology, including Aquinas, Descartes, Kant, Heidegger

**Warning**: This is one of the most challenging philosophical texts. Not a unified treatise but collection of lectures. Consider reading with commentary.

---

## Context Before Reading

- Understand Plato's Theory of Forms (what Aristotle is rejecting)
- Familiarity with Pre-Socratic questions about change and being (Heraclitus, Parmenides)
- Basic logic and Aristotelian categories
- Read *Physics* first if possible (background on nature, change, causation)

**Recommended Companions**:
- Terence Irwin - *Aristotle's First Principles*
- Jonathan Lear - *Aristotle: The Desire to Understand*

## Main Thesis

The science of being qua being (metaphysics/first philosophy) investigates the most fundamental principles and causes of reality. Substance is the primary category of being. Form and matter are the principles of substance. All change is explained by potentiality moving to actuality. The ultimate cause of all motion is the Unmoved Mover, pure actuality, thinking itself.

## Key Arguments

### 1. **Being Has Many Senses**
- "Being is said in many ways"
- Not univocal (same meaning) or equivocal (completely different)
- Pros hen equivocity: many meanings related to one central sense
- Central sense: substance (ousia)
- Other categories (quality, quantity, relation, etc.) are "of" substance

### 2. **Critique of Platonic Forms**
- Forms are supposed to explain sensible things but don't
- "Third Man" regress problem
- Separation of Forms from particulars is incoherent
- Forms don't explain change or motion
- Mathematics doesn't require Platonic entities

### 3. **Substance as Primary Being**
- Substance = that which exists independently, not predicated of anything else
- Primary substance: individual thing (this human, this horse)
- Secondary substance: species and genus (human, animal)
- Substance = substratum, essence, universal, or composite?
- Aristotle's answer: Form is primary substance (controversial interpretation)

### 4. **Hylomorphism** (Matter-Form Composition)
- All physical substances are composites of matter (hyle) and form (morphe)
- Matter = potential, form = actuality
- Form gives identity and essence
- Same matter can take different forms
- Prime matter = pure potentiality without any form

### 5. **Four Causes**
- Material cause: What something is made of
- Formal cause: What it is (essence, definition)
- Efficient cause: What brought it about
- Final cause: What it's for (purpose, telos)
- All four needed for complete explanation

### 6. **Potentiality and Actuality**
- Actuality (energeia) is prior to potentiality (dynamis)
- Change = movement from potentiality to actuality
- Solves Parmenides's problem: change is not from non-being to being, but from potential to actual
- Example: Acorn (potential oak) → Oak tree (actual oak)

### 7. **Unmoved Mover**
- There must be eternal motion (the heavens)
- Eternal motion requires eternal mover
- But this mover must itself be unmoved (otherwise infinite regress)
- Unmoved Mover = pure actuality, no potentiality
- Thinks only itself (thought thinking thought)
- Moves as object of desire, not efficient causation
- Aristotle's God: eternal, immaterial, perfect, but impersonal

## Important Concepts to Extract

### [[Substance and Accident]]
- Substance: exists independently (this human, this tree)
- Accidents: exist in substances (whiteness, height, location)
- Primary vs secondary substance
- Relation to subject-predicate logic

### [[Four Causes]]
- Four types of explanation needed for scientific knowledge
- Medieval: causa materialis, formalis, efficiens, finalis
- Modern science drops formal and final causes - just material and efficient
- Is this a loss? (Heidegger thinks so)

### [[Potentiality and Actuality]]
- Key to understanding change, motion, development
- Actuality prior in definition, time (for species), and substance
- Implications for ethics: we are not yet what we can become
- Influential for later philosophy (Aquinas, Leibniz, Hegel)

### [[Prime Mover]]
- First cause of all motion
- Pure actuality (no potentiality)
- Eternal, immaterial, perfect
- Self-thinking thought
- Does not create or intervene
- Influence on medieval theology (Aquinas's Five Ways)

### [[Essence]] (to ti ēn einai - "what it was to be")
- What makes a thing what it is
- Expressed in definition
- Form of the substance
- Distinguished from accidents
- Relates to necessity and possibility

## Critical Questions

### INTERPRETIVE
- Is primary substance the composite, form, or matter? Scholars disagree.
- How exactly does the Unmoved Mover cause motion if not efficiently?
- What is the relationship between substance in Categories vs Metaphysics?
- Is form universal or particular?

### CRITICAL
- Does Aristotle successfully refute Plato's Forms or just create new problems?
- Is the concept of prime matter coherent?
- Can there be scientific knowledge of individuals if science is of universals?
- Is the Unmoved Mover religiously significant or just a physical necessity?
- Has modern physics undermined Aristotelian substance ontology?

### COMPARATIVE
- How does Aristotle's substance compare to Plato's Forms?
- Aristotelian vs Cartesian substance - what changes?
- How does Kant's phenomenal/noumenal relate to Aristotle's matter/form?
- Buddhist rejection of substance (anatman) vs Aristotelian substance
- Process philosophy (Whitehead) vs substance ontology

### APPLIED
- Does modern physics require substances or can it work with processes/events?
- Do we need final causes (teleology) in biology?
- Is essentialism about natural kinds (species, elements) defensible?

### SYNTHETIC
- Can I accept Aristotelian insights about change while rejecting substance metaphysics?
- What survives of Aristotle's metaphysics after the scientific revolution?
- Is teleology inherently theological or can it be naturalized?

## Connections to Other Thinkers

- **[[@Plato - Parmenides]]** - Plato's own critique of Forms
- **[[Theory of Forms]]** - What Aristotle is rejecting
- **[[@Aquinas - Summa Theologica]]** - Christianizes Aristotelian metaphysics (Stage 3)
- **[[@Descartes - Meditations on First Philosophy]]** - Different conception of substance (Stage 3)
- **[[@Kant - Critique of Pure Reason]]** - Critiques traditional metaphysics including Aristotle (Stage 4)
- **[[@Heidegger - Being and Time]]** - Returns to question of being, critiques substance ontology (Stage 6)
- **[[Nagarjuna - Fundamental Verses of the Middle Way]]** - Buddhist rejection of substance (Stage 6)

## Why This Is Difficult

1. **Not a unified book** - Collection of lecture notes, some parts don't fit together
2. **Technical terminology** - Ousia, energeia, hyle, morphe, etc.
3. **Dense arguments** - Assumes knowledge of prior debates
4. **Translation issues** - Key terms have multiple meanings
5. **Scholarly disagreement** - Experts disagree on basic interpretations
6. **Background knowledge needed** - Logic, natural science, Plato, Pre-Socratics

**Recommendation**: Read slowly, use multiple translations, consult commentaries, focus on Books I, IV, VII, IX, XII initially.

## Books to Prioritize

### Essential (Start Here)
- **Book I**: Historical context, four causes
- **Book IV**: Being qua being, non-contradiction
- **Book VII**: Substance (most important but hardest)
- **Book IX**: Potentiality and actuality
- **Book XII**: Unmoved Mover

### Supplementary
- **Book III**: Aporiai (puzzles) - shows what problems Aristotle is addressing
- **Book V**: Lexicon - useful reference
- **Book XIII-XIV**: Critique of Plato

### Optional on First Read
- Books II, VI, VIII, X, XI - can return to these later
