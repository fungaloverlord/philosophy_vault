# @Plato - Phaedo

**Author**: Plato | **Stage**: [[Stage 2 - Ancient Greek Philosophy]] | **Branch**: Metaphysics, Epistemology

## Overview
Socrates' final hours and death. Plato's arguments for the immortality of the soul and the Theory of Forms.

## Key Arguments

**For Immortality:**
1. **Cyclical Argument**: Opposites come from opposites (life from death)
2. **Recollection Argument**: Learning is recollection, so soul pre-exists
3. **Affinity Argument**: Soul is like eternal Forms, not like perishable body
4. **Final Argument**: Soul brings life; what brings life cannot admit death

**For Forms:**
- Knowledge requires unchanging objects (Forms)
- Sensible things "participate" in Forms
- Soul knows Forms before birth

## Key Concepts
- [[Theory of Forms]]
- [[Theory of Recollection]]
- [[Soul-Body Dualism]]

## For Essay 2
The Recollection Argument here complements the Meno. Use both for your rationalist case in [[Stage 2 - Crossroads Essay 2]].
