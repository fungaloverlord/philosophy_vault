# @Epictetus - Enchiridion

**Author**: Epictetus (compiled by Arrian) | **Stage**: [[Stage 2 - Ancient Greek Philosophy]] | **Branch**: Ethics

## Overview
Stoic handbook for daily living. Short, practical, powerful. The dichotomy of control is foundational to Stoic practice.

## The Dichotomy of Control (Section 1)

**In your control:**
- Your beliefs
- Your judgments
- Your desires
- Your actions

**Not in your control:**
- Everything else (body, reputation, death, other people)

**The key:** Focus only on what you control. Accept what you don't.

**Create:** [[Stoic Dichotomy of Control]]

## Key Stoic Principles

1. **Live according to nature** (reason)
2. **Virtue is the only good**
3. **Accept fate** (amor fati)
4. **Fulfill your roles** (son, citizen, human being)
5. **Don't desire what isn't yours**

## Famous Quotes

> "It's not things that upset us, but our judgments about things." (5)

> "Don't demand that things happen as you wish, but wish that they happen as they do happen, and you will go on well." (8)

> "Remember that you are an actor in a play of such a kind as the author choosesâ€”if short, then in a short one; if long, then in a long one." (17)
