# @Epicurus - Letter to Menoeceus

**Author**: Epicurus | **Stage**: [[Stage 2 - Ancient Greek Philosophy]] | **Branch**: Ethics

## Overview
Epicurus' summary of his philosophy of happiness. Not hedonismâ€”"prudent pleasure" and freedom from pain (ataraxia).

## Key Teachings

**On Death:**
"Death is nothing to us. When we exist, death is not; when death exists, we are not."

**On Pleasure:**
- Pleasure = absence of pain (ataraxia)
- Not endless indulgence!
- Simple pleasures > complex ones
- Mental pleasure > bodily pleasure

**On the Gods:**
- Gods exist but don't interfere
- No need to fear divine punishment

**On Desires:**
1. **Natural and necessary** (food, shelter) - satisfy these
2. **Natural but unnecessary** (fancy food) - moderation
3. **Vain and empty** (fame, wealth) - avoid

## The Fourfold Remedy (Tetrapharmakos)

1. Don't fear god
2. Don't fear death
3. Pleasure is easy to obtain
4. Pain is easy to endure

**Create:** [[Epicureanism]], [[Ataraxia]]

## Compare to Stoicism
- Epicurus: Withdraw, seek pleasure, avoid politics
- Stoics: Engage, seek virtue, accept duty
