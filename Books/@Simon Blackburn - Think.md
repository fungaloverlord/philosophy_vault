## Why Read This?

Blackburn's *Think* stands out among introductory philosophy books for its **engaging, witty style** and **practical approach**. While Russell is systematic and Warburton is comprehensive, Blackburn is provocative and demonstrates **why philosophy matters for everyday life**.

Essential for:
- Learning to think critically about everyday assumptions
- Understanding philosophical puzzles through vivid examples
- Seeing how philosophy connects to real-world issues
- Developing intellectual self-defense
- Enjoying philosophy rather than just studying it

**Best for**: After Russell and Warburton, when you want to see philosophy come alive.

## Context Before Reading

- Written by British philosopher Simon Blackburn
- Intentionally accessible and conversational
- Uses humor and contemporary examples
- Focuses on practical reasoning and critical thinking
- Challenges readers to think for themselves
- No background required but rewards careful thought

## Main Thesis

We all operate with assumptions about knowledge, reality, morality, language, and reasoning. Philosophy examines these assumptions critically, exposes flaws in our thinking, and helps us develop better ways to think about ourselves and the world. Good thinking is a skill that can be learned, and philosophy is the training ground.

---

## Structure Overview

Unlike traditional survey books, *Think* is organized around **how we think** about various topics:

**Introduction**: What is Philosophy?
**Chapter 1**: Knowledge - How do we know anything?
**Chapter 2**: Mind - What is consciousness?
**Chapter 3**: Free Will - Are we free or determined?
**Chapter 4**: The Self - What am I?
**Chapter 5**: God - Does God exist?
**Chapter 6**: Reasoning - How should we reason?
**Chapter 7**: The World - What is real?
**Chapter 8**: What to Do - Ethics and how to live

---

## Key Arguments & Concepts by Chapter

### Introduction: What is Philosophy?

**Key Points**:
- Philosophy is thinking about thinking
- We all philosophize, but badly without training
- Philosophy provides intellectual self-defense
- Exposes hidden assumptions
- "Trying to understand the universe...and the world in front of our eyes"

**Blackburn's View**: Philosophy matters because bad philosophy leads to bad reasoning, and bad reasoning leads to bad decisions in life.

### Chapter 1: Knowledge

**Problems Addressed**:
- **Skepticism** - How do we know we're not dreaming? (Descartes)
- **Induction** - Why believe the future will resemble the past? (Hume)
- **Relativity of knowledge** - Is all knowledge perspectival?
- **The Gettier problem** - Is justified true belief really knowledge?

**Blackburn's Approach**:
- We can't achieve absolute certainty
- But we can distinguish better and worse reasons
- Skepticism is a philosophical puzzle, not a practical problem
- Knowledge requires appropriate connection to truth

**Important Concepts**:
- Justified true belief
- Gettier cases
- Foundationalism vs coherentism
- Fallibilism

### Chapter 2: Mind

**The Mind-Body Problem**:
- How does consciousness arise from matter?
- Dualism (Descartes) - mind and body separate
- Materialism - everything is physical
- Functionalism - mental states are functional roles
- The "hard problem" of consciousness (Chalmers)

**Key Arguments**:
- **Zombie argument** - Can there be beings physically identical to us but not conscious?
- **Knowledge argument** (Mary the color scientist) - Does knowing all physical facts give you all knowledge?
- **Qualia** - Subjective, qualitative character of experience

**Blackburn's View**:
- Neither pure dualism nor eliminative materialism is satisfactory
- The problem reveals limits of our current concepts
- We may need new concepts to understand consciousness

### Chapter 3: Free Will

**The Problem**:
- If everything is determined by prior causes, how can we be free?
- If our actions aren't determined, are they just random?
- Can we be responsible if we're not free?

**Positions Covered**:
- **Hard determinism** - We're not free; determinism is true
- **Libertarianism** (metaphysical) - We are free; determinism is false
- **Compatibilism** - Freedom and determinism are compatible

**Key Concept**: [[Compatibilism]]
- Frankfurt cases
- Freedom as acting on our desires
- Responsibility requires reasons-responsiveness, not ultimate sourcehood

**Blackburn's View**: Tends toward compatibilism - freedom is about acting for reasons, not about escaping causation.

### Chapter 4: The Self

**Questions**:
- What makes me the same person over time?
- Am I my body, my brain, my memories, my soul?
- Could I survive brain transplants? Teletransportation?

**Thought Experiments**:
- **Ship of Theseus** - If all parts are replaced, is it the same ship?
- **Brain transplant** - Does the person follow the brain or the body?
- **Fission** - If your brain halves go to two bodies, which is you?

**Theories**:
- **Soul theory** - The self is an immaterial soul (Descartes)
- **Body theory** - Personal identity is bodily continuity
- **Psychological continuity** (Locke) - Memory and consciousness
- **No-self view** (Hume, Buddhism) - The self is a bundle of perceptions

**Blackburn's View**: No simple answer - our concept of personal identity may be vague and admit borderline cases.

### Chapter 5: God

**Arguments Examined**:
- **Cosmological** - First cause argument
- **Design** - Argument from order/complexity
- **Ontological** - From the concept of God
- **Problem of evil** - If God is good and powerful, why evil?
- **Pascal's Wager** - Pragmatic reasons to believe

**Blackburn's Approach**:
- Examines each argument critically
- Shows weaknesses in traditional proofs
- Problem of evil is particularly challenging for theism
- Faith may not be rational, but may not need to be

**Critical Analysis**:
- Design argument undermined by natural selection
- Ontological argument commits fallacy (existence not a property)
- Problem of evil remains unanswered
- Pascal's Wager has problems (which God to wager on?)

### Chapter 6: Reasoning

**Focus**: How to think well

**Topics**:
- **Deductive reasoning** - Logic and validity
- **Inductive reasoning** - Generalization from cases
- **Abductive reasoning** - Inference to best explanation
- **Fallacies** - Common mistakes in reasoning
- **Probability** - Bayesian reasoning

**Common Fallacies**:
- Ad hominem - Attacking the person
- Straw man - Misrepresenting opponent's view
- False dichotomy - Presenting only two options
- Slippery slope - Claiming small step leads to disaster
- Begging the question - Assuming what you're trying to prove

**Blackburn's Focus**: Practical reasoning skills - how to spot bad arguments and construct good ones.

### Chapter 7: The World

**Metaphysics**:
- What is real?
- Mind-independent reality vs idealism
- Scientific realism vs anti-realism
- What exists? (Ontology)

**Questions**:
- Are numbers real? (Platonism vs nominalism)
- Are properties real? (Universals vs particulars)
- What about possible worlds?
- Is reality socially constructed?

**Blackburn's View**: Pragmatic approach - some questions about "ultimate reality" may be meaningless or unanswerable.

### Chapter 8: What to Do (Ethics)

**Ethical Theories**:
- **Consequentialism** (Utilitarianism) - Rightness determined by outcomes
- **Deontology** (Kant) - Rightness determined by duty
- **Virtue ethics** (Aristotle) - Focus on character
- **Moral relativism** - Morality is relative to culture

**Key Questions**:
- Is morality objective or subjective?
- Are there moral facts?
- Can reason tell us how to live?
- What makes actions right or wrong?

**Blackburn's View**:
- Moral realism with pragmatic elements
- We can reason about ethics
- Emotions and reason both play roles
- Ethics is about how to live well, not just rules
