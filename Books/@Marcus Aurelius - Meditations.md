# @Marcus Aurelius - Meditations

**Author**: Marcus Aurelius | **Stage**: [[Stage 2 - Ancient Greek Philosophy]] | **Branch**: Ethics

## Overview
Personal journal of a Roman Emperor (121-180 CE) practicing Stoic philosophy. Not meant for publication—raw, honest self-examination. Philosophy as lived practice.

## Key Themes

### 1. Impermanence
"All things are ephemeral—both memory and the object of memory."

Everything passes. Don't cling.

### 2. Duty & Virtue
"Do what nature requires. Set yourself in motion, if it is in your power, and don't worry whether anyone will know it."

Focus on right action, not recognition.

### 3. The View from Above
Look at human affairs from cosmic perspective. See how small your troubles are.

### 4. Morning Meditation
Book 2:1 — Prepare for difficult people. You'll meet them. Remember: you're not perfect either.

### 5. Accept Fate (Amor Fati)
"A cucumber is bitter? Throw it away. There are briars in the path? Turn aside from them. This is enough. Do not add, 'And why were such things made in the world?'"

**Create:** [[Amor Fati]]

## Selected Passages for Practice

**Book 2:1** — Morning meditation
**Book 4:3** — Nothing outside your mind can disturb you
**Book 5:8** — Everything is interconnected
**Book 7:68** — You have power over your mind
**Book 8:47** — The universe is change, life is opinion
**Book 12:36** — Soon you'll be ashes or bones

## Stoic Practices from Marcus

1. **Morning preparation**: Meditate on obstacles you'll face
2. **Evening review**: How did you handle challenges?
3. **Negative visualization**: Remember impermanence
4. **View from above**: Cosmic perspective
5. **Fulfilling your role**: Emperor, human, rational being

## Why This Matters

Unlike other Stoics, Marcus was emperor of Rome. This proves Stoicism works under extreme pressure—philosophy in action, not just theory.
