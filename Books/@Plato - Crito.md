**Stage**: [[Stage 2 - Ancient Greek Philosophy]]
**Period**: Ancient Greek (c. 399 BCE)

## Overview

Crito visits Socrates in prison and offers to help him escape. Socrates refuses, arguing that escaping would be unjust. Short but powerful dialogue on justice, law, and civil disobedience.

## Key Question

- Socrates: No! Never do injustice, even in response to injustice

## Key Arguments

**Socrates' Reasons Not to Escape:**
1. Never do wrong, even if wronged
2. Social contract with Athens (the Laws speak)
3. Escaping would harm Athens
4. Must practice what he preaches

**Create:** [[Q - When is civil disobedience justified]]

## Key Quote

> "One must obey the commands of one's city and country, or persuade it as to the nature of justice." (51b-c)
