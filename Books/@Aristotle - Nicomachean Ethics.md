# @Aristotle - Nicomachean Ethics

**Difficulty**: Intermediate

**Reading Time**: 4-5 weeks

## Why Read This?

Aristotle's *Nicomachean Ethics* is the foundational text of virtue ethics and one of the most influential works in moral philosophy. Unlike deontological or consequentialist ethics, Aristotle focuses on character development, the good life, and human flourishing (eudaimonia). This work is essential for understanding:

- The concept of virtue as a mean between extremes
- The role of habit in moral development
- What constitutes the good life for humans
- The relationship between ethics and politics
- How reason and emotion should interact

---

## Context Before Reading

- Understanding of Plato's Theory of Forms (which Aristotle critiques)
- Familiarity with Socratic ethics and the role of virtue
- Basic understanding of Greek concepts: *arete* (excellence), *telos* (purpose)

---

## Main Thesis

Happiness (eudaimonia) is the highest good for humans, achieved through living a life of virtue in accordance with reason. Virtue is a state of character concerned with choice, lying in a mean relative to us, determined by practical wisdom. The good life is an activity of the soul in accordance with excellence over a complete lifetime.

---

## Structure Overview

**Book I**: The Good for Man - Eudaimonia as the highest good
**Book II**: Moral Virtue - How virtue is acquired through habit
**Book III**: Voluntary Action - Conditions for moral responsibility
**Book IV-V**: Individual Virtues - Courage, temperance, justice, etc.
**Book VI**: Intellectual Virtues - Practical wisdom (phronesis) vs theoretical wisdom (sophia)
**Book VII**: Weakness of Will - Akrasia and self-control
**Book VIII-IX**: Friendship - Three types and their role in the good life
**Book X**: Pleasure and Happiness - Contemplation as highest happiness

---

## Key Arguments

### 1. **Eudaimonia as the Highest Good**
- All actions aim at some good
- Happiness (eudaimonia) is the only end pursued for its own sake
- Eudaimonia = activity of soul in accordance with virtue over complete life
- NOT mere pleasure or momentary feeling, but flourishing

### 2. **The Function Argument**
- Everything has a characteristic function (ergon)
- Human function = rational activity
- Good human life = performing this function well
- Therefore: excellence in rational activity = eudaimonia

### 3. **Virtue as a Mean**
- Virtue lies between excess and deficiency
- Example: Courage is mean between cowardice and recklessness
- The mean is relative to the individual and situation
- Requires practical wisdom (phronesis) to determine

### 4. **Virtue Acquired Through Habit**
- We become virtuous by doing virtuous acts
- Moral virtue is a state of character, not innate
- Requires practice and repetition
- Like learning a skill: become just by doing just acts

### 5. **Role of Practical Wisdom**
- Phronesis = ability to deliberate well about what is good
- Different from theoretical wisdom (sophia)
- Requires experience and maturity
- Unifies the virtues: cannot have one without the others

## Important Concepts to Extract

### [[Eudaimonia]]
- Translate as "flourishing" or "living well", not just "happiness"
- Activity, not state
- Requires external goods, virtue, and complete lifetime
- Compare to hedonic vs eudaimonic conceptions of well-being

### [[Virtue Ethics]]
- Focus on character rather than rules or consequences
- Question: "What kind of person should I be?" not "What should I do?"
- Virtues are excellences of character
- Contrast with Kantian deontology and utilitarianism

### [[Golden Mean]]
- Virtue as mean between vices of excess and deficiency
- Not arithmetic mean, but relative to person and situation
- Examples: courage (between cowardice and recklessness), generosity (between stinginess and wastefulness)
- Requires practical wisdom to identify

### [[Practical Wisdom (Phronesis)]]
- Intellectual virtue concerned with action
- Ability to deliberate well about particular situations
- Cannot be reduced to rules
- Developed through experience
- The "eye" of the soul that sees the mean

### [[Akrasia]] (Weakness of Will)
- Acting against one's better judgment
- How is it possible if virtue is knowledge (Socrates)?
- Distinction between intellectual understanding and experiential knowledge

## Critical Questions

### INTERPRETIVE
- What exactly does Aristotle mean by eudaimonia? Is it subjective or objective?
- How does the doctrine of the mean apply to justice and friendship?
- What role do external goods play in eudaimonia?

### CRITICAL
- Can virtue ethics provide action-guidance in specific situations?
- Is the function argument sound? Do humans have a single function?
- Does the doctrine of the mean work for all virtues?
- Is Aristotle's ethics too elitist? (Requires leisure, education, material goods)

### COMPARATIVE
- How does Aristotelian virtue differ from Platonic virtue?
- Can Aristotle's virtue ethics be reconciled with Kantian duty ethics?
- How does eudaimonia compare to Buddhist conceptions of well-being?
- Is Nietzsche's critique of virtue fair? Would he reject Aristotle?

### APPLIED
- How do I cultivate virtue in modern life?
- Can corporations or institutions be virtuous in Aristotelian sense?
- What would Aristotelian education look like today?

### SYNTHETIC
- What virtues does Aristotle miss that are important today? (Humility, authenticity?)
- Can I accept virtue ethics while rejecting Aristotle's metaphysics?
- How do I balance Aristotelian flourishing with other ethical concerns (justice, rights)?

## Connections to Other Thinkers

- **[[Q - Plato vs Aristotle on Forms]]** - Rejects transcendent Forms, virtues are immanent
- **[[Socratic Method]]** - Continues emphasis on self-examination but adds habituation
- **[[Stoicism]]** - Influenced Stoic ethics, but Stoics reject external goods for happiness
- **[[Aquinas - Summa Theologica]]** - Christianizes Aristotle's ethics (Stage 3)
- **[[Kant - Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals]]** - Deontology as alternative to virtue ethics (Stage 4)
- **[[Nietzsche - On the Genealogy of Morals]]** - Critiques virtue as life-denying (Stage 5)
- **[[MacIntyre - After Virtue]]** - 20th century revival of virtue ethics (Stage 7)
