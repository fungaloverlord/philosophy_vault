- [[Q - Can virtue be taught]]
- [[Q - What is the good life]]
- [[Q - Stoic tranquility vs Nietzschean passion]]

## Reflection Questions

- How does the Socratic method differ from teaching as telling?
- Plato vs. Aristotle: Is the good life about contemplating eternal truths or practical wisdom?
- How do Stoics and Epicureans offer different responses to "How should we live?"

## Weekly Practice

- **Socratic dialogue**: Practice questioning your own beliefs
- **Virtue journal**: Track one Aristotelian virtue you're developing
- **Comparative analysis**: Write 500 words comparing two thinkers

## Major Revisitation Points

**Revisit after [[Stage 4 - Enlightenment & Existential Roots]]**:
- How do Kant's categories of understanding relate to Plato's Forms?
- Can you combine Kantian duty with Aristotelian virtue?

**Revisit after [[Stage 5 - Nietzsche Deep Dive]]**:
- Is Socratic rationalism the birth of decadence?
- Is Aristotelian virtue compatible with will to power?
