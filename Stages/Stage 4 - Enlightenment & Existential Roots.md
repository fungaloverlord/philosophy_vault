## Practice

- **Kantian exercise**: Act only on maxims you could will to be universal laws (1 week)
- **Hegelian thinking**: Explore a contradiction in your life for synthesis
- **Schopenhauerian aesthetics**: Achieve "will-less" contemplation with art

## Major Prep for [[Stage 5 - Nietzsche Deep Dive]]

- What is Kant's moral framework that Nietzsche will attack?
- What does Hegel's historical progress mean for values?
- How does Schopenhauer set up Nietzsche's problems?

## Revisitation

**Return to [[Stage 2 - Ancient Greek Philosophy]]**:
- Does Kant's synthetic a priori vindicate Plato's Forms?
- How does Kant's ethics differ from Aristotle's virtue ethics?
