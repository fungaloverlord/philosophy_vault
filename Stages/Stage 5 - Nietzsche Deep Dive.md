# Stage 5: Nietzsche Deep Dive

**Goal**: Understand Nietzsche thoroughly—his critiques, his constructive philosophy, and his legacy.

**Duration**: 3-4 months
**Status**: Not Started

## Context Before Starting

By now you understand:
- Greek virtue ethics (what he admires)
- Christian moral philosophy (what he attacks)
- Kant's morality (a primary target)
- Schopenhauer's pessimism (what he transforms)
- The Enlightenment project (what he thinks fails)

## Early Nietzsche (3-4 weeks)

- [[@Nietzsche - The Birth of Tragedy]]
- [[@Nietzsche - Untimely Meditations]]

## Middle Period - The Free Spirit (4-5 weeks)

- [[@Nietzsche - Human All Too Human]]
- [[@Nietzsche - Daybreak]]
- [[@Nietzsche - The Gay Science]]

## Late Period - Mature Philosophy (6-7 weeks)

- [[@Nietzsche - Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]
- [[@Nietzsche - Beyond Good and Evil]]
- [[@Nietzsche - On the Genealogy of Morals]]
- [[@Nietzsche - Twilight of the Idols]]
- [[@Nietzsche - The Antichrist]]
- [[@Nietzsche - Ecce Homo]]

## Core Concepts

- [ ] [[Death of God]]
- [ ] [[Will to Power]]
- [ ] [[Eternal Recurrence]]
- [ ] [[Master-Slave Morality]]
- [ ] [[Ressentiment]]
- [ ] [[Übermensch]]
- [ ] [[Perspectivism]]
- [ ] [[Revaluation of Values]]
- [ ] [[Amor Fati]]
- [ ] [[Apollonian vs Dionysian]]
- [ ] [[Ascetic Ideal]]

## Essential Secondary Sources

- Walter Kaufmann - Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist
- Alexander Nehamas - Nietzsche: Life as Literature
- Brian Leiter - Nietzsche on Morality
- Gilles Deleuze - Nietzsche and Philosophy
- Bernard Reginster - The Affirmation of Life

## Key Questions

- [[Q - What does God is dead mean]]
- [[Q - Is the Übermensch attainable]]
- [[Q - Is Nietzsche a nihilist or does he overcome nihilism]]
- [[Q - Master vs slave morality description or judgment]]
- [[Q - Can there be truth without objective truth]]

## Deep Engagement Practices

- **Genealogical thinking**: Trace a modern moral value's psychological origins
- **Perspectival writing**: Write about same event from 3 different perspectives
- **Eternal recurrence exercise**: Would you will your life to repeat eternally?
- **Value creation**: Identify one herd value you've internalized and revalue it

## Integration Project

**Essay (3000 words)**: "My Response to Nietzsche: What I Accept, What I Reject, and Why"

Address:
- Which Nietzschean critiques succeed?
- Which fail?
- Can you live according to Nietzschean principles?
- Where do you depart from Nietzsche?

## Major Revisitation

**Return to [[Stage 2 - Ancient Greek Philosophy]]**:
- Is Socratic rationalism the birth of decadence?
- Is the Theory of Forms a "true world" that devalues this world?
- Is Aristotelian virtue compatible with will to power?

**Return to [[Stage 4 - Enlightenment & Existential Roots]]**:
- Does Nietzsche successfully demolish Kantian ethics?
- Where exactly do Nietzsche and Schopenhauer diverge?
