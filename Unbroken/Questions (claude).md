# ðŸ”„ Philosophy Study Guide: Questions & Revisitation Framework

**Purpose:** This document provides targeted questions for each stage of study and guides you on when to revisit earlier thinkers with new philosophical lenses. Philosophy is best learned spirallyâ€”returning to ideas with deeper context creates profound insights.

## ðŸ“‹ HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE

### The Five Question Types

For every text you read, work through these five levels:

1. **INTERPRETIVE** - What is the philosopher actually saying?
2. **CRITICAL** - Is the argument sound and convincing?
3. **COMPARATIVE** - How does this relate to other thinkers?
4. **APPLIED** - How does this matter for life?
5. **SYNTHETIC** - What is MY position?

### Revisitation Schedule

- **After each stage:** Return to Stage 1-2 readings with new questions
- **Monthly:** Pick one earlier text and reread with current knowledge
- **Quarterly:** Write a comparative essay connecting past and present reading
- **Yearly:** Reread your foundational texts (Plato, Aristotle, key Nietzsche works)

## ðŸ’¡ CONCLUSION: THE EXAMINED LIFE

Philosophy is not about accumulating answers but about deepening questions. This guide provides questions for every stage, but the most important questions are the ones you discover yourself.

As you progress, you'll find that earlier texts reveal new depths, that seemingly opposed thinkers actually complement each other, and that the questions you thought settled remain open.

This is not a bugâ€”it's the feature of philosophy. The point is not to finish, but to continue examining, questioning, and living thoughtfully.

**Remember Socrates:** The unexamined life is not worth living.

**Remember Nietzsche:** One must still have chaos in oneself to give birth to a dancing star.

**Remember Camus:** One must imagine Sisyphus happy.

Now go forth and philosophize. The questions await.
